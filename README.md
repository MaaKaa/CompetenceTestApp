Online competence test app, dedicated to NGOs. It allows NGOs to find out which competencies volunteers developed through its projects.

BACKGROUND/ GENERAL DESCRIPTION:

Volunteers support non-governmental organisations (NGOs) with different activities: they do administrative works (e.g. project coordination, office assistance), (co-)organize events, do promotion and fundraising, share their skills, etc. There are different reasons they do it: sometimes NGO's mission is important for them (e.g. they care for ecology), sometimes they want to gain some job experience, and sometimes they just want to pay-off, because someone helped them in the past.
But no matter the reason, the fact is that every volunteering experience is an opportunity for them to develop crucial soft skills and transversal competencies that may be valuable on the labour market.

Thanks to this app NGOs can:

    1. Generate a competence test for a particular project,
    2. Ask volunteers to fill it in,
    3. View the results: find out, what volunteers learnt through this project.

Benefits:

    - NGO becomes more aware on which competencies can be developed within its projects - thus, it becomes more attractive for volunteers.
    - Volunteers are empowered - they become more aware of their competencies and learn how to valuate their experience.


HOW IT WORKS?

NGOs' perspective:

    - NGO regiesters.
    - After logging-in, the NGO generates a competence test for its project: enters project's name and description, and saves it.
    - Then, the NGO can invite volunteers: types volunteer's name and email address, and the app sends the invitation containing the link to the competence test.
    - Volunteer takes the competence test and saves it. (S)he is redirected to the results page.
    - NGO can view cumulative results for the project.
    - In it's dashoborad, the NGO can: create a new test, view and edit all its competence tests, as well as view the overall tests' statistics.

Volunteer's perspective:

    - Volunteer receives an invitation.
    - (S)he clicks on the link and log-in.
    - (S)he takes the competence test and saves it.
    - (S)he is redirected to the results page where (s)he can see her/his results, together with the development tips for each competence.
    - On her/his dashboard volunteer can view all invitations, take the test and view the results of the tests already taken.
